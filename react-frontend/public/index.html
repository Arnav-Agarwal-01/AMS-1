<!--
  -i presume that you are familiar with npm and how to install a boilerplate application by using it, if not learn about that first
  -this file and some other folders and files are created by the "create-react-app" script
  -create-react-app sets up a complete react development environment to speed up application development
  -the boilerplate application is very simple, doing not much more than showing a static HTML page
  -to put the focus on the building blocks of the MERN (MongoDB, express, React, Node) stack and how they are working together
  -I made the boilerplate application even simpler by deleting all unnecessary code
  -Also I didn't do any CSS styling (except very little to make the HTML table recognizable as a table ...)

  -in order to understand how the application is working just read through the comments and the code
  -whenever somethings happen in another file, I'll recommend to open the other file in a comment

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

      When you run 'npm start' he build process will add code to this file that loads and runs the JavaScript that you will find in
      index.js

      You can see who the final index.html file that will be sent to the browser looks like by opening the development tools of your browser

      ************Open the file index.js in order to see how the content of the div tag with the id "root" will be updated by JavaScript*****************

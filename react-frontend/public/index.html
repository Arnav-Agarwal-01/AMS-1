<!--
  -this file and some other folders and files are created by the "create-react-app" script
  -i presume that you are familiar with npm, if not learn about that first
  -this sets up a complete react development environment to speed up application development
  -the starting point already is a very simple application doing not much more the showing a static HTML page
  -to put the focus on the necessary building blocks of the MERN (MongoDB, express, React, Node) Stack and how they are working together
  -I deleted all unnecessary code, which makes the starting point even cleaner and easier to understand

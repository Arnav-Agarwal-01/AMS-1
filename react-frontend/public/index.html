<!--
  -this file and some other folders and files are created by the "create-react-app" script
  -i presume that you are familiar with npm and how to install a boilerplate application by using it, if not learn about that first
  -create-react-app sets up a complete react development environment to speed up application development
  -the boilerplate application is very simple already doing not much more than showing a static HTML page
  -to put the focus on the necessary building blocks of the MERN (MongoDB, express, React, Node) stack and how they are working together
  -I made it even simpler by deleting all unnecessary code
  -for example I didn't do any CSS styling but instead only use plain HTML to focus on the application logic

  -in order to understand how the application is working just read through the comments and the code
  -whenever somethings happen in another file, I'll recommend to open the other file in a comment

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

      In the build process code will be added to this file in order to load and run the JavaScript that you will find in
      index.js
